eBilling
========

eBilling application:

Summary:
eBilling is a SQL, ASP, CSS etc application for processing cell phone bill electronically per DoS guidlines and procedures.

The core application was built initially by Jakarta but has been heavily modified by Zagreb.

Future enhancements will include residential service billing, desk phone billing and potentialy other billing as necessary.
We will also be working to port this to use in the FAN when avalible.
